```sql
SELECT CAR_ID, ROUND(AVG(DATEDIFF(END_DATE, START_DATE) + 1), 1) AS AVERAGE_DURATION
FROM CAR_RENTAL_COMPANY_RENTAL_HISTORY
GROUP BY CAR_ID
HAVING AVERAGE_DURATION >= 7
ORDER BY AVERAGE_DURATION DESC, CAR_ID DESC

=> ROUND(number, (반올림 할 자릿수)-1) -> 반올림 함수
	DATEDIFF(A, B) -> A를 B로 뺀 결과를 일수로 반환
```
